      <h3>PREFACE</h3>
      <p>
        This handbook is the first in a series of five handbooks that describes
        contemporary opposing forces (OPFORs) for training Continental Army
        officers, staff and units. See the bibliography section for a list of
        manuals that are in this series. Together, these manuals outline a
        series of OPFORs that reflects the entire spectrum of military and
        paramilitary capabilities of contemporaneous adversaries against which
        the Army must train to ensure success in any future conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        This handbook provides a general overview of the OPFORs that can be used
        for training and represents the definitive source of unclassified
        information on major adversaries that the Army may expect to face as
        well as its strength, weaknesses and features in comparison to them.
        This handbook should not be used alone when creating an OPFOR and must
        only be used as a quick reference or guide.
      </p>
