    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>
      This handbook is the first in a series of five handbooks that describes
      contemporary opposing forces (OPFORs) for training Continental Army
      officers, staff and units. See the bibliography section for a list of
      manuals that are in this series. Together, these manuals outline a series
      of OPFORs that reflects the entire spectrum of military and paramilitary
      capabilities of contemporaneous adversaries against which the Army must
      train to ensure success in any future conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      This handbook provides a general overview of the OPFORs that can be used
      for training and represents the definitive source of unclassified
      information on major adversaries that the Army may expect to face as well
      as its strength, weaknesses and features in comparison to them. This
      handbook should not be used alone when creating an OPFOR and must only be
      used as a quick reference or guide.
